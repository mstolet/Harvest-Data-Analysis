## Installation
All we need to have for this project is:
    Pandas (see how to install: https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/57487/como-instalar-a-biblioteca-pandas-no-python-3)
    Numpy (see how to install: https://numpy.org/install/)
    Statsmodels (see how to install: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/install.html)
And a text editing program. I am using Jupyter Notebook, you can learn how to install it in: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

## Usage
This code is helpfull when it comes to running t-tests and correlations tests on a database to test whether a hypothesis is true or false.

## Tasks Descriptions

# Task 1
Test whether: People that register more hours monthly are the ones that also register time one or more entries with no description or notes.

# Task 2
Create a list classifying projects considering the amount of work done by task names.

# Task 3
Test whether: programmers who created entries and spent more than 3 hours in the same entry are those who have more entries without notes.

# Task 4
Test whether: people who create manual entries have a more even distributed work time during the week, i.e., they work in a regular pace every day, registering the same average amount of hours per day.

# Task 5
Create and test three hypothesis:
    1) People who spend more hours working are the same that enter more programming tasks. 
    2) People work more hours when the client's currency is USD.
    3) People work less hours in december.
